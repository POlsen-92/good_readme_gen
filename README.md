## Description
feature project 1 in this course along with 3 other homework assignments. For the work features the photos 
<pre>
	The goal for this project was to utilize our understanding of node and command line applications which 
accept user input. To complete the assignment we had to create a number of command line prompts which would
log our response and then input them into their proper place within a markdown skeleton using Javascript.

	Thus, creating a concise, professional ReadMe for developers to use. This app is designed to decrease
the amount of time a developer needs to take on producing a readme and can also be used to get responses 
from developers that contributed to a project.

	Below you can see an image link which will take you to a video walkthrough of the ReadMe generator so you 
can see how it works and try it for yourself. There are several licenses to choose from and more can easily 
be added using the key, value based function that I used. By giving your Github username and email the 
generator will create working links. If one wants to provide a personal photo and screenshot of their app
they can also do so. Once the markdown document is created it will be named based off the title you gave 
the project so that it can be easily found and all of the links within the table of contents work.
